        <h1 style="color:blue"> Scorbunny </h1>
        <p style="color: blue"> The fire starter of the Galar Region. A warm-up of running around gets fire energy coursing through this Pokémon’s body. Once that happens, it’s ready to fight at full power. It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these pads radiate tremendous heat. </p>

        <h1 style="color:orange"> Grookey </h1>
        <p style="color:orange"> The grass starter of the Galar Region. When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area. It attacks with rapid beats of its stick. As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets more and more pumped. </p>

        <h1 style="color:greenyellow"> Sobble </h1>
        <p style="color:greenyellow"> The water starter of the Galar Region. When scared, this Pokémon cries. Its tears pack the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers won’t be able to resist weeping. When it gets wet, its skin changes color, and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if it were camouflaged. </p>
